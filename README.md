## Introduction

Python ecosystem consists of a big amount of various classes, functions and 
objects that could be used for applications development. Each of them has its 
own role.

Modern Python applications are mostly the composition of well-known open 
source systems, frameworks, libraries and some turnkey functionality.

When application goes bigger, its amount of objects and their dependencies 
also increased extremely fast and became hard to maintain.

`Objects` is designed to be developer's friendly tool for managing objects 
and their dependencies in formal, pretty way. Main idea of `Objects` is to 
keep dependencies under control.

## Installation

Objects library is available on [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Objects):
