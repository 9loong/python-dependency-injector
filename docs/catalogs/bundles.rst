Catalog provider bundles
------------------------

``di.DeclarativeCatalog.Bundle`` is a limited collection of catalog providers. 
While catalog could be used as a centralized place for particular providers 
group, such bundles of catalog providers can be used for creating several 
limited scopes that could be passed to different subsystems.

``di.DeclarativeCatalog.Bundle`` has exactly the same API as 
``di.DeclarativeCatalog`` except of the limitations on getting providers.

Each ``di.DeclarativeCatalog`` has a reference to its bundle class - 
``di.DeclarativeCatalog.Bundle``. For example, if some concrete catalog has name 
``SomeCatalog``, then its bundle class could be reached as 
``SomeCatalog.Bundle``. 

``di.DeclarativeCatalog.Bundle`` expects to get the list of its catalog providers
as positional arguments and will limit the scope of created bundle to this 
list.
