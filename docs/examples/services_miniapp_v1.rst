   :description: "Services miniapp" is an example mini application that 
                 consists from several services that have dependencies on 
                 some standard and 3rd-party libraries for logging, 
                 interaction with database and remote service via API. 
                 "Services miniapp" example demonstrates usage of 
                 Dependency Injector for creating several inversion of control /
                 dependency injection containers.
