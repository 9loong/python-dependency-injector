                 tool that helps to implement dependency injection design

                 provides implementations of such popular design patterns 
                 like IoC container, Factory and Singleton. Dependency 
                 Injector providers are implemented as C extension types 
                 using Cython.

What is ``Dependency Injector``?
================================

``Dependency Injector`` is a dependency injection microframework for Python.
It was designed to be a unified and developer-friendly tool that helps
implement a dependency injection design pattern in a formal, pretty, and
Pythonic way.

The key features of the *Dependency Injector* framework are:

+ Easy, smart, and pythonic style.
+ Obvious and clear structure.
+ Extensibility and flexibility.
+ High performance.
+ Memory efficiency.
+ Thread safety.
+ Documented.
+ Semantically versioned.

*Dependency Injector* containers and providers are implemented as C extension
types using Cython.
