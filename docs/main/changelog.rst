=========

This document describes all the changes in *Dependency Injector* framework 
that were made in every particular version.

From version 0.7.6 *Dependency Injector* framework strictly 
follows `Semantic versioning`_


Development version
-------------------

- Add simplified syntax of kwarg injections for ``Factory`` and ``Singleton`` 
  providers: ``Factory(SomeClass, dependency1=injectable_provider_or_value)``.
- Add simplified syntax of kwarg injections for ``@inject`` decorator:
  ``@inject(dependency1=injectable_provider_or_value)``.
- Add minor refactorings.
- Fix of minor documentation issues.

0.8.1
-----
- ``Objects`` is renamed to ``Dependency Injector``.

0.7.8
-----
- Fixing @inject import bug in examples.

0.7.7
-----
- Fixing minor bug in concept example.

0.7.6
-----

- Adding support of six from 1.7.0 to 1.9.0. 
- Factory / Singleton providers are free from restriction to operate with 
  classes only. This feature gives a change to use factory method and 
  functions with Factory / Singleton providers.
- All attributes of all entities that have to be protected was renamed using 
  ``_protected`` manner. 
- Providers extending was improved by implementing overriding logic in 
  ``Provider.__call__()`` and moving providing logic into 
  ``Provider._provide()``.
- ``NewInstance`` provider was renamed to ``Factory`` provider. 
  ``NewInstance`` still can be used, but it considered to be deprecated and 
  will be removed in futher releases.
- ``@inject`` decorator was refactored to keep all injections in 
  ``_injections`` attribute of decorated callback. It will give a possibilty to
  track all the injections of particular callbacks and gives some performance 
  boost due minimizing number of calls for doing injections.
- A lot of documentation updates were made.
- A lot of examples were added.
- Some minor refactorings were done.
