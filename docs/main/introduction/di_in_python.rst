Dependency Injection in Python
------------------------------

Interesting but, dependency injection is not very popular topic in Python. 
The things are so because Python is an awesome language. Your eyes are opened
and your hands are free while you are using Python. In practice this means that
you can do dependency injection in Python in quite an easy way because language
itself helps you to do this. At the same time, even the thins are so, you still
have to do some work. Another one 'minor' problem is that there are several 
ways to do dependency injection container.
