Providers
=========

Providers are strategies of accessing objects. They define how particular 
objects are provided.

Base providers class is - :py:class:`dependency_injector.providers.Provider`

Every provider is callable (implements ``__call__()``). Every call to provider 
instance returns provided result, according to the providing strategy of 
particular provider.

library and some useful information like overriding of providers and writing 
of custom providers.

All providers are validated in multithreading environment and considered to 
be thread safe.
